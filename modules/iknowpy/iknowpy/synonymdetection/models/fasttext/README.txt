This is the directory to store fastText models. Unforuntately, fastText models
are too large to store even with the superficial example corpus in this repo.

A model trained on that corpus is still over 1GB!

So there is just this readme as a placeholder :(

To get access to actual trained FT models, contact me (Michael) on Teams or
